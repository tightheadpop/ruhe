#Installing and using Ruhe

= Introduction =

Currently, Ruhe consists only of libraries for web controls and utilities. As such, the only installation necessary is to copy the assemblies to a location and reference them from your project. The Ruhe.Web assembly references some system assemblies and the following:
  * Ruhe.Common
  * System.Web.Extensions (ASP.NET Ajax)
  * AjaxControlToolkit
The non-system assemblies are included in the download for the sake of simplicity. You can use your own copies of each, if you prefer.
