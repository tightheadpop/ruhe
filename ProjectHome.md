Ruhe is a toolkit for fast composition of web forms.  Input controls are self-validated based on properties, but may also be extended easily.  The suite also includes
controls and interfaces for managing form customizations and setup
across your entire site.

Ruhe depends on [ASP.NET Ajax](http://asp.net/AJAX/) and the [Ajax Control Toolkit](http://asp.net/AJAX/AjaxControlToolkit/), building with some of the controls and functionality provided by those libraries.
